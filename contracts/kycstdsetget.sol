JDAllen.

Primary setter and getter for KYC/STD/PoC on-chain.

This SC is seperate from the  listings.sol (peter) - diff data structs
and  encompass also the functions
for set/ get a listing and any client reports ? (Peter) - architecture confirm.

Arguments for these on-chain state - determined as 4 and set as strings
Could reduce to bytes32 for less gas usage..  TBD -- depends on KYC/STD/PoC data
that needs to be stored by various entities.

SafeMath not needed.

WIP. 20 / 4 / 18.

The _address is the on-file wallet address of the Service Provider
